This is designed so that the library is contained in one directory structure and need not occupy a specific place within any higher level structure.

The library directory and files can be placed anywhere in the users file hierarchy.

The library can be used just by making sure the include directory is available during the compilations of source files which use it.

The library will include files named CMakeLists.txt to support the CMake build system
