# Introduction

Basic tooling and introduction to unit testing.

# Unit Testing

In later sessions we will be using unit tests and the https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md[Google.Test] framework.

https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.12/module/GoogleTest.html[Here] is an introduction for using Google.Test with CMake.

Download and instructions https://github.com/google/googletest[here].

Adding to CLion https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/creating-google-test-run-debug-configuration-for-test.html[here].

The file gtest_installer.sh is a sample of how to download, build, and install GTest on your local machine.

If you are on a Mac or Ubuntu, add the GTEST_DIR and GMOCK_DIR to your .bash_profile or .bashrc.  On Windows, create the environment variables and add them to your path.
